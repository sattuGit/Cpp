memory allocation in C++ class 
-------------------------------------
All the non-static members are organised in memory much like a struct
static members stored separately (One copy )
class function :
	its similer to normal function , placed in global space 
	only diffrence is , calling have one additional argumnet called this pointer 
Q: can you delete this pointer 
	[edit: the code for the function itself is not stored with your object -- this allows you to do fun things like delete this and continuing execution of a member function provided you no longer access the object you just deleted].


Q: How virtual table works 
	* Any method define as virtual , 
	will be automaticly defined as virtual in all derived class by compiler 
	*The virtual method table is the same for all objects belonging to the same class, 
	and is therefore typically shared between them.
	* each object have one pointer VPTR to virtual table for each class (each VPTR add 8 byte in size in 64bit ) 
	*Virtual table stores NULL pointer to pure virtual functions in ABC.
