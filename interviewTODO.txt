Q:can construtor be a virtual 
ANS: NO 
Details :

two reasons I can think of:
Technical reason
The object exists only after the constructor ends.In order for the constructor to be dispatched using the virtual table , there has to be an existing object with a pointer to the virtual table , but how can a pointer to the virtual table exist if the object still doesn't exist? :)
Logic reason
You use the virtual keyword when you want to declare a somewhat polymorphic behaviour. But there is nothing polymorphic with constructors , constructors job in C++ is to simply put an object data on the memory . Since virtual tables (and polymorphism in general) are all about polymorphic behaviour rather on polymorphic data , There is no sense with declaring a virtual constructor.

Q: what is base and drive both are virtual 
Ans : once a member function is declared as a virtual function in a base class, it becomes virtual in every class derived from that base class. 
writting keyword Virtual is not required 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Q: size of class 
Ans : 
		sum of all memeber variales size 
	Special case :
		A) if no member variales then 1 byte 
		=> so that class have to have some memory which helps to assign address (each class should have unique address)
		B) in some case padding may occure 
		C) member functions and static data members are not participated in size of class  
		D) in case if Virtual additional memory for VTPR (Virtual Table pointer) (for 64 bit compiler it would be 8 byte)

Q: Can we initalize static members in constructor ?
Ans: No.
	we can use static variable inside construtor but not inilalize 
	constructor is inbetween process of creating objects(while execution of constructor rutine , object is not in created state)
	but static members should be fully prepared when there definition loaded into memory
