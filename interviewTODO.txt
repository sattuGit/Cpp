Q:can construtor be a virtual 
ANS: NO 
Details :

two reasons I can think of:
Technical reason
The object exists only after the constructor ends.In order for the constructor to be dispatched using the virtual table , there has to be an existing object with a pointer to the virtual table , but how can a pointer to the virtual table exist if the object still doesn't exist? :)
Logic reason
You use the virtual keyword when you want to declare a somewhat polymorphic behaviour. But there is nothing polymorphic with constructors , constructors job in C++ is to simply put an object data on the memory . Since virtual tables (and polymorphism in general) are all about polymorphic behaviour rather on polymorphic data , There is no sense with declaring a virtual constructor.

Q: what is base and drive both are virtual 
Ans : once a member function is declared as a virtual function in a base class, it becomes virtual in every class derived from that base class. 
writting keyword Virtual is not required
