Q: can constructor be private :
	Yes , example singleton 
Q: can distructor can be virtual
	Yes 
	private distructor class can't have stack object ie must be created using new 
	
Q: can virtual function be static 
	virtual function always access through pointer so can't be static 
	
Q: can we have virtaul constructor, can we have virtaul distructor
	We can have a virtual destructor but not have a virtual constructor.

	logic : constructor cannot be virtual, 
	because when a constructor of a class is executed there is no virtual table in the memory, 
	means no virtual pointer defined yet. So, the constructor should always be non-virtual.
	
	By same logic we can't initilize static variable in constructor(others reason too )
